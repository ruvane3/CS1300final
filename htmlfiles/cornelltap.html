  <p>Welcome to <b>Take Back the Tap at Cornell!</b></p>

  <p>Take Back the Tap is a student initiative at Cornell to reduce the supply and demand of bottled water, ultimately to eliminate the sale of bottled water on campus and reinvest in public water infrastructure. </p>

  <p>Check out “The Story of Bottled Water” for an introduction to the story of manufactured demand—how you get Americans to buy more than half a billion bottles of water every week when it already flows from the tap. Over seven minutes, the film explores the bottled water industry’s attacks on tap water and its use of seductive, environmental-themed advertising to cover up the mountains of plastic waste it produces. The film concludes with a call to ‘take back the tap,’ not only by making a personal commitment to avoid bottled water, but by supporting investments in clean, available tap water for all.</p>
